# Getting Started with LucyBot

LucyBot uses your repository to build it's documentation - a website
containing any Markdown, code snippets, schemas, OpenAPI operations,
or apiDoc contained in your repo.

If your code is public and on GitHub, you can use LucyBot for free by
visiting [lucybot.com/opensource](https://lucybot.com/opensource). Just
enter the name of your repo - we'll fork it and host your documentation
at lucybot.github.io/your-repo.  You're welcome to merge our fork and
host the documentation elsewhere.

Paid users will gain access to additional features:
* Branding and Customization
* SEO Optimization
* User and Event Tracking (via Mixpanel, Google Analytics, or Jaro)
* Performance Optimization and Prerendering
* Add CSS and JavaScript
* Custom navbar and footer
* Custom Bootstrap themes

See [Creating a LucyBot.yml file](/docs/Getting_Started/Create_a_LucyBot_yml_file) for more
details on how you can customize your documentation.
